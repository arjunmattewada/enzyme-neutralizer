# Enzyme Neutralizer

This repository explores the computational design of enzyme-based neutralizers for small-molecule drugs, starting with cytochrome P450 (CYP) variants to accelerate flunitrazepam metabolism.

The project focuses on in silico protein engineering approaches, including structure prediction, docking, and molecular dynamics, to evaluate how targeted mutations affect substrate binding, orientation, and catalytic plausibility.

## Scope

- Rational redesign of cytochrome P450 enzymes (initially CYP2C19)
- Structure prediction and confidence analysis
- Ligand docking and pose evaluation
- Molecular dynamics for stability and conformational behavior
- Iterative mutation design and comparative analysis

This work is currently computational and exploratory. No wet-lab validation is included at this stage.

## Motivation

Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) remains difficult to prevent once a sedative has entered the body. Existing prevention tools focus on obstruction or detection prior to ingestion. This project explores a third category: enzymatic neutralization of small-molecule drugs after exposure, inspired by enzyme supplementation models such as lactase for lactose intolerance.

## Status

Early-stage research and pipeline development. Methods, assumptions, and results are expected to evolve as the project progresses.

## Notes

This repository is maintained as a research log and development workspace. Conclusions should be treated as provisional and subject to further validation.
